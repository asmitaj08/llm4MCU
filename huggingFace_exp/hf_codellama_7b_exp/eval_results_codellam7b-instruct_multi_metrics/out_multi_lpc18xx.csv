lpc18xx,What is the bit_offset of B04_0 field from PAL[224] register from LCD peripheral for LPC18xx microcontroller?,10,224,"224:224 PAL[224] Pixel data. 23:0 PCD_LO Lower five bits of panel clock divisor. The ten-bit PCD field, comprising PCD_HI (bits 31:27 of this register) and PCD_LO, is used to derive the LCD panel clock frequency LCDDCLK from the input clock, LCDDCLK = LCDCLK/(PCD+2). For monochrome STN displays with a 4 or 8-bit interface, the panel clock is a factor of four and eight down from the actual individual pixel clock rate. For color STN displays, 22/3 pixels are output per LCDDCLK cycle, so the panel clock is 0.375 times the pixel rate. For TFT displays, the pixel clock divider can be bypassed by setting the BCD bit in this register. Note: data path latency forces some restrictions on the usable minimum values for the panel clock divider in STN modes: Single panel color mode, PCD = 1 (LCDDCLK = LCDCLK/3). Dual panel color mode, PCD = 4 (LCDDCLK = LCDCLK/6). Single panel monochrome 4-bit interface mode, PCD = 2(LCDDCLK = LCDCLK/4). Dual panel monochrome 4-bit interface mode and single panel monochrome 8-bit interface mode, PCD = 6(LCDDCLK = LCDCLK/8). Dual panel monochrome 8-bit interface mode, PCD = 14(LCDDCLK = LCDCLK/16). 5 CLKSEL Clock Select. This bit controls the selection of the source for LCDCLK. 0 = the clock source for the LCD block is CCLK. 1 = the clock source for the LCD block is LCDCLKIN (external clock input for the LVD). 10:6 ACB AC bias pin frequency. The AC bias pin frequency is only applicable to STN displays. These require the pixel voltage polarity to periodically reverse to prevent damage caused by DC charge accumulation. Program this field with the required value minus one to apply the number of line clocks between each toggle of the AC bias pin, LCDENAB. This field has no effect if the LCD is operating in TFT mode, when the LCDENAB pin is used as a data enable signal. 11:7 IVS Invert vertical synchronization. The IVS bit inverts the polarity of the LCDFP signal. 0 = LCDFP pin is active HIGH and inactive LOW. 12:2 ACB AC bias pin frequency. The AC bias pin frequency is only applicable to STN displays.
