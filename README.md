# datasheet-llm

N.B : Used Python Version : 3.10
After cloning this repo, add the env file to the directory

Run the first cell (pip...) to install all necessary libraries 

Works best in a conda environment 

use uart.pdf for quick testing (estimate ~2 hours to ingest the pdf on CPU), I need to check how to run this using gpu, preferably within generate_text_summaries and generate_image_summaries and encode image 

a vectore store is in the repo, I need to still figure out how to use it instead of ingesting the pdf every time I run the notebook.
